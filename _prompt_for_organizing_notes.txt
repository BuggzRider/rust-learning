// =====================================
// PROMPT: AUTOMATED RUST NOTES ORGANIZER
// =====================================
//
// For each topic provided (as a brief heading or bullet), create a separate Rust source file in the `src/` directory.
// - Each file should be named after the topic (use snake_case).
// - At the top of each file, add a clear header comment explaining the concept, including a brief description, relevant details, and at least one code example.
// - The code should be idiomatic and runnable.
// - Do not create or update any README.md file.
// - Do not explain your actionsâ€”just create the files with the notes and examples, following the style and structure used in the `variables-and-mutability` folder.
//
// Use this file as a reference prompt for future automation of Rust notes organization.
